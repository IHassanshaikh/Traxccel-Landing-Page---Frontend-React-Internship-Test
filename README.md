# Traxccel-Landing-Page---Frontend-React-Internship-Test
This responsive React landing page was created for my Frontend React Internship test at Traxccel, based on a Figma design. It includes sections like Banner, Services (with scroll animations), FAQ, Clients, and Booking, with features like responsiveness and animations using GSAP/Framer Motion.
